CP4CDS is a project to develop data services in support of the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://climate.copernicus.eu/). Led by the STFC [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis](www.ceda.ac.uk), CP4CDS is providing access to:
- Quality assured climate projections from CMIP5 and CORDEX, via [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) data and index nodes
- Bespoke Compute Nodes - delivering access to hosted processing
- A packaging framework - for sharing and receiving software environments
- A resilient service infrastructure - supporting synchronisation across 3 European sites

The *aim of this portal* it to provide a single access point to the CP4CDS resources which we provide to
the Climate Change Service.

## Quick Access to our Services

Here is collection of the CP4CDS web services (data and compute):

* [Data Quality Control App](https://cp4cds-qcapp.ceda.ac.uk/)
* [Geographically load-balanced ESGF search end-point for C3S Climate Model Simulations](https://index.mips.copernicus-climate.eu/esg-search/search)
* [Geographically load-balanced Compute Service using the Web Processing Service standard interface](http://compute.mips.copernicus-climate.eu/wps?service=WPS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCapabilities)
* [Compute Demo App](https://bovec.dkrz.de/)
* [GeoHealthCheck Demo for WPS Compute Service](https://bovec.dkrz.de/ghc/resources?lang=en&resource_type=OGC%3AWPS)
