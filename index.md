CP4CDS is a project to develop data services in support of the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://climate.copernicus.eu/). Led by the STFC [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis](www.ceda.ac.uk), CP4CDS is providing access to:
- Quality assured climate projections from CMIP5 and CORDEX, via [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) data and index nodes
- Bespoke Compute Nodes - delivering access to hosted processing
- A packaging framework - for sharing and receiving software environments
- A resilient service infrastructure - supporting synchronisation across 3 European sites

The **aim of this portal** is to provide a set of links to the services/tools provided by CP4CDS.
This portal does *not* act as a client to the CP4CDS services and should not be considered as a tool 
for accessing data directly.
