CP4CDS is a project to develop data services in support of the the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Led by the STFC [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis](www.ceda.ac.uk), CP4CDS is providing access to:
- Quality-controlled climate simulations from CMIP5, via
- ESGF Data and Index Nodes
- Bespoke Compute Nodes - delivering access to hosted processing
- A packaging framework - for sharing and receiving software environments
- A resilient service infrastructure - supporting synchronisation across 3 European sites

Find out more about how we are doing these things:
- [svcs/authn.md](Authentication) - let's get this one out of the way first...important stuff you need to know how to do :-)
- [tools/find_data.md](Finding data) - search with `esgf-pyclient` and `synda`.
- [tools/get_data.md](Getting data) - download/replicate with `esgf-pyclient` and `synda`.
- [svcs/compute.md](The CP4CDS Compute Node) - built on the DKRZ `birdhouse` WPS environment.
- [svcs/processes.md](Running computations) - executing jobs on the Compute Node.
- [tools/pyclient.md](ESGF Pyclient) - python library for searching ESGF holdings.
- [tools/wps.md](The Birdhouse Web Processing Service framework) - a server and client environment for hosted processing.
- [tools/sdds.md](The CP4CDS Software Dependency Deployment Solution***) - a framework for defining and sharing software environments.
- [tools/synda.md](Synda) - python command-line tool for searching, selecting, downloading and replicating ESGF data.
- [svcs/deploy.md](Deployment and load-balancing) - using Kubernetes and Docker.
- [misc/drs_plus.md](Extending the DRS) - to allow greater data specification - suitable for processing inputs.
